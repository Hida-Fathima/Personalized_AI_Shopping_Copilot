# Personalized AI Shopping Copilot

A multimodal, conversational AI assistant for a truly personalized and intuitive shopping experience.

Project Overview

The AI Shopping Copilot is designed to revolutionize the e-commerce journey by replacing rigid, keyword-based searches with a fluid, conversational, and intelligent shopping partner. The core innovation lies in its multimodal architecture, which allows the system to understand user intent from multiple forms of inputâ€”not just what they type, but also what they see.

This project aims to build a full-fledged e-commerce application powered by a sophisticated AI engine. Users can interact with the copilot as they would with a human shopping assistant, asking complex questions, getting personalized recommendations, and even using images to find the products they desire.

Core Features (Current & Planned)
Conversational Search: Go beyond keywords. Ask for things like, "I need a dress for a summer wedding that's not too formal."

Visual Search (Search by Image): See something you like? Upload a photo, and our copilot will find visually similar items in the store. This is the heart of our multimodal capability.

Hybrid Recommendation Engine: The AI synthesizes user conversations, image inputs, and browsing history to provide highly relevant, context-aware product suggestions.

Interactive Chat Interface: A clean, modern chat UI for seamless interaction with the AI copilot.

Full E-commerce UI: A complete, responsive storefront built with React to browse products, view details, and manage a cart.

The AI Engine Explained
Our copilot is powered by advanced deep learning models, primarily leveraging the Google Gemini API. The AI operates on two parallel streams:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): At its core, a powerful transformer-based model interprets complex, conversational text. It understands nuances, context, and intent, allowing for a natural dialogue between the user and the shopping assistant.

Computer Vision (CV): The system employs a sophisticated vision model to analyze user-uploaded images. It extracts key features like color, pattern, shape, and style to find visually analogous products, effectively bridging the gap between inspiration and purchase.

These two streams are fed into a hybrid recommendation engine that synthesizes the information to generate a curated list of products, delivering a uniquely intelligent and fluid shopping journey.

Technology & Architecture
This project is built on a modern, serverless, and scalable tech stack.

Frontend: React & Tailwind CSS

Backend: Firebase Functions (Node.js)

Database: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)

AI Engine: Google Gemini API

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) & Firebase Hosting (Backend)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Project Roadmap
This project will be developed in distinct phases to ensure a structured and agile workflow.

Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

Initialize project structure, repositories, and cloud services (Firebase, Vercel).

Phase 2: Frontend UI & Database

Build the static e-commerce UI with React.

Set up and populate the Firestore database with product data.

Phase 3: AI Backend Development

Develop and test the core AI logic in Firebase Functions.

Integrate with the Google Gemini API for text and image processing.

Phase 4: Integration & Deployment

Connect the React frontend with the backend functions.

Build the interactive chatbot interface.

Deploy the full application and conduct end-to-end testing.
